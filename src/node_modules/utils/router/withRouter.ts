// 注: ts bug中不能直接使用 装饰器去调用withRouter ts会检测报错

// There is a known issue in TypeScript, which doesn't allow decorators to change the signature of the classes
// they are decorating. Due to this, if you are using @withRouter decorator in your code,
// you will see a bunch of errors from TypeScript. The current workaround is to use withRouter() as a function call
// on a separate line instead of as a decorator.

import { withRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
export default (dom: any): any => { return withRouter(dom); };
